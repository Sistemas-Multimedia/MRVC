# TO-DO list

1. Increase pixel accuracy in ME/MC.
2. Use MC-linear-Haar transform, and other transforms.
3. Use different MB sizes (split in function of the entropy in the previous frame and move the splitting pattern with the motion).
4. Use an overlapped spatial transform or a deblocking filter.
5. Avoid transmitting the motion using a spatially multiresolution approach.
